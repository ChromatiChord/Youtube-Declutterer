# Youtube-Declutterer
## What is this app?
A Javascript-based Chrome extension that removes clutter from the Youtube player interface, and allows for faster and more finely tuned playback.

## Installation Instructions:
1. Download this Git repository.
2. In Chrome, click the three dots on the top right corner of your screen.
3. Select More Tools -> Extensions.
4. Enable Developer Mode with the switch in the top right hand corner.
5. Select "Load Unpacked" on the top left, and select the the downloaded Github folder.
6. Enable the extension!

## Why is this not just on the Chrome Store?:
Google asks for a $5 sign up fee to upload apps to the Chrome store, and I don't want to do that.
